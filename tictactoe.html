            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Test-Driven Development (TDD) Tutorial! In this tutorial, we'll embark on a journey of building a Tic-Tac-Toe game using the principles of Test-Driven Development.
                TDD is a powerful approach to software development that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. By following this approach, we ensure that our code is well-tested and reliable, which is crucial for creating robust applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout this tutorial, we'll go step by step, from setting up the project to implementing the game logic, all while adhering to the TDD methodology. You'll witness firsthand how tests guide our development process, leading to well-structured and thoroughly tested code.
            </p>
            <p>
               Whether you're new to TDD or an experienced developer looking to apply it in a practical scenario, this tutorial will provide you with valuable insights into both TDD and game development. By the end of this journey, you'll have not only a working Tic-Tac-Toe game but also a solid understanding of how TDD can enhance your development workflow. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's get started by setting up our project and laying the foundation for our Tic-Tac-Toe game. Get ready to code, test, and play!

    <h2>Playing the First Move</h2>
    <p>
        In this section, we'll begin our journey by writing our very first test. We'll focus on allowing players to make the first move and placing "X" in the chosen cell. Let's dive into the process of writing a test and making it pass!
    </p>

    <h3>Writing the First Test</h3>
    <p>
        The first step is to create a test that checks whether players can place an "X" in the chosen cell when making the first move.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-java">
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo;

public class GameBrainTests {
    @Test
    void whenPlayingFirstMoveThenXAppearsToTheCell() {
        Game game = new Game();

        game.playMove(0);

        assertThat(game.getCell(0), equalTo("X"));
    }
}
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Implementing the Functionality</h3>
    <p>
        Now that we have our test in place, it's time for a challenge! Go ahead and try to implement the functionality yourself to make the test pass. You can use the provided test as a guide, and feel free to experiment with your code.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your task is to create the <code>Game</code> class with the necessary methods to allow players to place their moves and check the cells. Use your programming skills to make the test pass and see "X" appear in the chosen cell.
    </p>

    <p>
        Remember, Test-Driven Development encourages an iterative process of writing tests, implementing code, and refining. Don't hesitate to experiment and iterate until your test passes successfully!
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you've given it a try, you can compare your solution with the provided implementation below.
    </p>

        <pre><code class="language-java">
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Game {
    private final List<String> boardState;
    private String activePlayer = "X";

    public Game() {
        this.boardState = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            boardState.add(" ");
        }
    }

    public void playMove(int cell) {
        boardState.set(cell, activePlayer);
    }

    public String getCell(int cell) {
        return boardState.get(cell);
    }
}
        </code></pre>
    </details>

    <p>
        With the test successfully passing, we've taken our first step towards building our Tic-Tac-Toe game using Test-Driven Development!
